How can we measure Germany climate protection level? In this cooperation with taz, we were interested in investigating to which extents Germany’s pledges to implement climate protection strategies are followed by concrete regional development. We selected five different indicators for climate protection: mobility, waste, energy, buildings, and agriculture.  We located, analysed, and visualised relevant data for each of these indicators at a regional level.
