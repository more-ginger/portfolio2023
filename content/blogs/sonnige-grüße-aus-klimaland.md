How can we measure Germany climate protection level? In this cooperation with taz, we investigated to which extents Germany’s pledges to implement climate protection strategies are followed by concrete regional development. We selected five different indicators for climate protection: mobility, waste, energy, buildings, and agriculture.  We located, analysed, and visualised relevant data for each of these indicators at a regional level.

### Multi-channel and highly customizable

We designed and produced both physical and digital postcards containing visualizations covering all five indicators. The postcards exist for each of the 401 districts and 16 states in Germany. A central ambition here is that the communication of climate change should not cause readers to feel anxious, numb, or even enter a state of shock, but develop an interest and engage locally with climate change and its ramifications.

![The image shows the default mode of the web interface for Klimakarten. Without any set parameter in the search bar, all postcards are visible for the indicators. The postcards are arranged on the screen as they would lie on the table, by interacting with them the user can activate them and see the details of each visualization.](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-01-at-20.42.51.png "The first view of the web prototype")

The journalists are able to embed the postcards on the homepage of the newspaper website and in articles via an iframe. They can alter the presentation of the postcards in four different modes and hereby customize them according to the needs of a given article.

*Klimakarten has been a collaboration with the newspaper taz, in particular with Luise Strothmann, Lalon Sander, Jean-Philipp Baeck, and Jelene Malkowski. This research is connected with the project “VIDAN: Visual and dynamic arrangements of narratives”, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and conducted at FHP’s UCLAB.*
