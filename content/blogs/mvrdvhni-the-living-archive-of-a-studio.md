Project developed for “MVRDVHNI: The Living Archive of a Studio” exhibition. The platform arranges, on a timeline, the topics discussed by MVRDV in their documents and email exchanges, from 1990 to 2010.


After gaining access to the MVRDV architecture studio’s archive, we decided to visualise how they talked about architecture for over 10 years. We started by collecting, cleaning and unwrapping all the e-mails between colleagues, contractors and the PR team. We extracted the relevant words that dealt with the financial, environmental or material aspects of architecture. Then we created a couple of visualisations that allow exploration, where users can filter relevant terms according to their category and frequency.
On top of this we trained an AI using the material for PR. Visitors can feed the AI few words to draft a speculative MVRDV project. @mvrdvsht is the twitter fee where this non-sense architecture is collected.
